# Walkie Talkie (FRS Channel Monitor) for Flipper Zero

📻 Listen in on FRS walkie-talkie channels with your Flipper Zero. Tunes the built-in CC1101 radio to the 22 standard FRS channels and plays whatever it hears through the speaker, with auto-squelch and a channel scanner.

> **Receive-only.** This app does not transmit, and it does not decode CTCSS/DCS — subchannel numbers are labels for matching your handheld radio's display, not a privacy-code filter.
>
> It also cannot play FM broadcast radio; those frequencies are outside the CC1101's supported bands.

## ✨ Features

- All 22 standard FRS channels (462/467 MHz) with a scrollable channel list
- Channel scanner: scans up or down, pauses automatically when a signal is detected, and resumes after the transmission ends
- Auto-squelch with adjustable sensitivity (or turn it off to hear raw static)
- Live RSSI readout with a 5-bar signal-strength meter
- Subchannel (privacy-code) labels 1–38 for quick reference
