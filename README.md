# Walkie Talkie — FRS Channel Scanner for Flipper Zero

> **Audio limitation:** The CC1101 data mirror is a digital receive-data stream, not
> demodulated analog voice. Treat this app as a channel activity/RSSI scanner unless
> external demodulation hardware is added; speaker output is not reliable FRS voice.

📻 Listen in on FRS walkie-talkie channels with your Flipper Zero. Tunes the built-in CC1101 radio to the 22 standard FRS channels and plays whatever it hears through the speaker, with auto-squelch and a channel scanner.

> **Receive-only.** This app does not transmit, and it does not decode CTCSS/DCS — subchannel numbers are labels for matching your handheld radio's display, not a privacy-code filter.
>
> It also cannot play FM broadcast radio; those frequencies are outside the CC1101's supported bands.

## ✨ Features

- All 22 standard FRS channels (462/467 MHz) with a scrollable channel list.
  The seven 467 MHz interstitial channels (8–14) sit outside the CC1101's
  supported bands: on official firmware they are skipped and shown as "N/A",
  while extended-range firmwares (e.g. Unleashed, Momentum) can tune them
- Channel scanner: scans up or down, pauses automatically when a signal is detected, and resumes after the transmission ends
- Auto-squelch with adjustable sensitivity (or turn it off to hear raw static)
- Live RSSI readout with a 5-bar signal-strength meter
- Subchannel (privacy-code) labels 1–38 for quick reference
